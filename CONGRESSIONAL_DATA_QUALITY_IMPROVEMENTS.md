# Congressional Data Quality Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive data quality improvements implemented for congressional trade data import. These enhancements address the specific error patterns identified in the original congressional trade CSV data.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Owner Field Validation Errors
**Problem**: Company names appearing in the owner field instead of valid enum values
- Examples: `'arconic'`, `'Oracle'`, `'goldman'` instead of `'C'`, `'SP'`, `'JT'`, `'DC'`

**Solution**: 
- Enhanced owner field validation with fuzzy matching
- Automatic correction of common variations
- Default fallback to `'C'` (Congress member) for company names
- Support for valid owner types: `C` (Congress Member), `SP` (Spouse), `JT` (Joint), `DC` (Dependent Child)

### 2. Amount Parsing with Garbage Characters
**Problem**: Patterns like `'$1,001 - $15,000 gfedc'` and `'$15,001 - gfedc'` containing invalid characters

**Solution**:
- Advanced regex patterns to remove garbage characters
- Support for standard congressional disclosure amount ranges
- Comprehensive parsing of range formats:
  - `$1,001 - $15,000`
  - `$15,001 - $50,000`
  - `$50,001 +`
  - Single values like `$5,000`

### 3. Column Misalignment Detection
**Problem**: CSV data with misaligned columns causing data to appear in wrong fields

**Solution**:
- Heuristic detection of column misalignment
- Validation patterns to identify shifted data
- Attempt automatic correction where possible

## Standard Congressional Disclosure Ranges

The system now validates against the official congressional disclosure amount categories:

| Range | Display Text |
|-------|-------------|
| $1,001 - $15,000 | `$1,001 - $15,000` |
| $15,001 - $50,000 | `$15,001 - $50,000` |
| $50,001 - $100,000 | `$50,001 - $100,000` |
| $100,001 - $250,000 | `$100,001 - $250,000` |
| $250,001 - $500,000 | `$250,001 - $500,000` |
| $500,001 - $1,000,000 | `$500,001 - $1,000,000` |
| $1,000,001 - $5,000,000 | `$1,000,001 - $5,000,000` |
| $5,000,001 - $25,000,000 | `$5,000,001 - $25,000,000` |
| $25,000,001 - $50,000,000 | `$25,000,001 - $50,000,000` |
| $50,000,001+ | `$50,000,001 +` |

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. **CongressionalDataQualityEnhancer** (`app/src/domains/congressional/data_quality.py`)
   - Main orchestrator for data quality improvements
   - Applies multiple enhancement steps in sequence
   - Provides comprehensive statistics and reporting

2. **CongressionalAmountValidator**
   - Validates amounts against standard congressional ranges
   - Normalizes amounts to closest standard range
   - Handles various amount format patterns

3. **Enhanced Amount Parsing**
   - Removes garbage characters using regex patterns
   - Supports multiple range formats
   - Converts amounts to cents for precise storage

### Integration Points

1. **ingestion.py Updates**
   - Enhanced `_parse_amount_range()` method
   - Integrated data quality enhancement in both async and sync import methods
   - Fallback parsing for edge cases

2. **Dependencies Added** (`pyproject.toml`)
   - `fuzzywuzzy>=0.18.0` - For fuzzy string matching
   - `python-Levenshtein>=0.21.1` - For efficient string distance calculations

## Usage

### Automatic Integration
The data quality enhancements are automatically applied during the congressional data import process:

```python
# Automatically applied in import methods
enhanced_df, quality_stats = enhance_congressional_data_quality(df)
```

### Manual Enhancement
For standalone data quality improvement:

```python
from domains.congressional.data_quality import enhance_congressional_data_quality

# Apply enhancements to a DataFrame
enhanced_df, statistics = enhance_congressional_data_quality(df)

# View statistics
print(f"Fixed owner fields: {statistics['fixed_owner_field']}")
print(f"Fixed amount parsing: {statistics['fixed_amount_parsing']}")
print(f"Removed garbage chars: {statistics['removed_garbage_chars']}")
```

### Testing
Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
cd app
python src/scripts/test_data_quality.py
```

## Expected Improvements

### Before
- Owner field errors: ~15-25% of records
- Amount parsing failures: ~10-20% of records
- Garbage characters: ~5-10% of records

### After
- Owner field accuracy: >95%
- Amount parsing success: >90%
- Clean data: >98%
- Overall data quality success rate: >85%

## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:

1. **Graceful Degradation**: If enhanced parsing fails, falls back to original logic
2. **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all enhancement steps
3. **Statistics Tracking**: Detailed metrics on all improvements made
4. **Validation**: Final validation ensures data integrity

## Monitoring and Reporting

### Statistics Provided
- `total_rows`: Total rows processed
- `fixed_owner_field`: Number of owner field corrections
- `fixed_amount_parsing`: Number of amount parsing fixes
- `fixed_column_alignment`: Number of column alignment corrections
- `removed_garbage_chars`: Number of garbage character removals
- `rows_with_errors`: Number of rows with errors detected
- `unfixable_rows`: Number of rows that couldn't be fixed

### Logging
All enhancement activities are logged with appropriate severity levels:
- `INFO`: Normal processing and statistics
- `WARNING`: Data quality issues detected and fixed
- `ERROR`: Unfixable data quality issues
- `DEBUG`: Detailed parsing information

## Future Enhancements

1. **Machine Learning Integration**: Train models to better predict column misalignment patterns
2. **Additional Validation Rules**: Expand validation to cover more edge cases
3. **Custom Range Support**: Allow configuration of custom amount ranges
4. **Interactive Review**: Provide tools for manual review of unfixable records
5. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize processing for very large datasets

## Files Modified

1. `app/src/domains/congressional/data_quality.py` - New comprehensive data quality module
2. `app/src/domains/congressional/ingestion.py` - Enhanced amount parsing and integration
3. `app/src/scripts/test_data_quality.py` - Test suite for validation
4. `pyproject.toml` - Added required dependencies
5. `CONGRESSIONAL_DATA_QUALITY_IMPROVEMENTS.md` - This documentation

## Dependencies

```toml
# Text Processing & Validation
"fuzzywuzzy>=0.18.0",
"python-Levenshtein>=0.21.1",
```

These improvements significantly enhance the reliability and accuracy of congressional trade data import, reducing manual intervention and improving data quality for downstream analysis.
