### **Gathering Results**

#### **1. Evaluation Metrics**
- Define the metrics used to assess the performance of the system:
  - **Data Pipeline**:
    - Latency of data ingestion and processing.
    - Error rates (e.g., failed API calls, missing data).
  - **Machine Learning Models**:
    - Accuracy metrics:
      - Regression: MAE, RMSE, RÂ².
      - Classification: Precision, Recall, F1-score.
    - Backtesting performance:
      - ROI, profit/loss, Sharpe ratio.
  - **System Performance**:
    - Prediction latency.
    - AWS resource utilization (e.g., EC2 CPU/GPU usage).

#### **2. Feature Impact Analysis**
- Evaluate the predictive power of Congress trading data:
  - Contribution of Congress trades to model accuracy.
  - Comparison of results with and without Congress features.
- Analyze the importance of technical indicators and engineered features.

---

#### **3. Usability Testing**
- Assess ease of use for:
  - Simulated trading environment.
  - Web interface for visualizations.
- Gather user feedback on system functionality and insights.

---

#### **4. Scalability and Stability**
- Test scalability under larger datasets or additional features (e.g., premium APIs, live trading).
- Monitor stability of AWS-hosted components (e.g., uptime, error logs).

---

#### **5. Lessons Learned**
- Document challenges encountered during development and deployment.
- Note areas for future improvement (e.g., more sophisticated models, additional data sources).

---

#### **6. Recommendations for Future Development**
- Outline potential enhancements:
  - Advanced machine learning models (e.g., transformers).
  - Live trading integration with APIs like Alpaca or Interactive Brokers.
  - Additional data features (e.g., sentiment analysis from news, policy impacts).
