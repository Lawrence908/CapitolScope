### **Milestones**

The milestones for the **CapitolScope** project are organized to track progress systematically and ensure deliverables align with the defined requirements and method. Each milestone includes key deliverables, estimated timelines, and dependencies.

---

#### **Milestone 1: Data Pipeline**
- **Deliverables**:
  1. API integration scripts for AlphaVantage and yFinance.
  2. Congress data ingestion pipeline.
  3. Data cleaning and normalization scripts.
  4. Raw data storage in PostgreSQL or AWS RDS.
- **Timeline**: Week 1–2
- **Dependencies**: Access to APIs, database setup.

---

#### **Milestone 2: Data Processing**
- **Deliverables**:
  1. Feature engineering scripts for technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, volatility).
  2. Integration of Congress data into the feature set.
  3. Processed data storage in a separate database table (`processed_data`).
- **Timeline**: Week 3
- **Dependencies**: Completion of the data pipeline.

---

#### **Milestone 3: MVP ML Models**
- **Deliverables**:
  1. Initial models using Scikit-learn (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
  2. Evaluation metrics (e.g., MAE, RMSE, Precision, Recall) stored in a results database.
  3. Exported trained models in `.pkl` format.
- **Timeline**: Week 4–5
- **Dependencies**: Processed data availability.

---

#### **Milestone 4: Backtesting**
- **Deliverables**:
  1. Backtesting scripts to simulate trades using model predictions.
  2. Performance reports comparing model outputs to historical benchmarks.
  3. Logs of simulated trades stored in the database.
- **Timeline**: Week 6
- **Dependencies**: Trained models.

---

#### **Milestone 5: Deployment**
- **Deliverables**:
  1. AWS EC2 instance setup for hosting data pipelines and ML components.
  2. S3 buckets configured for raw and processed data storage.
  3. Simulated trading environment hosted on AWS.
  4. Flask/Django web interface for visualizing predictions and Congress signals.
- **Timeline**: Week 7–8
- **Dependencies**: Backtesting scripts, AWS credentials.

---

#### **Milestone 6: TensorFlow Upgrade**
- **Deliverables**:
  1. Time-series preprocessing pipeline for TensorFlow (e.g., sequence-based features).
  2. LSTM/GRU models trained with GPU acceleration.
  3. TensorFlow models saved in `.h5` or `SavedModel` format.
  4. Comparison of deep learning results with MVP models.
- **Timeline**: Week 9–12
- **Dependencies**: Processed data, GPU setup.

---

#### **Milestone 7: Performance Tracking**
- **Deliverables**:
  1. Automated tracking of model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, ROI) stored in a `model_performance` table.
  2. System logs for data ingestion, model predictions, and simulated trades.
  3. Dashboard integration for performance visualization.
- **Timeline**: Week 12+
- **Dependencies**: Deployment, TensorFlow upgrade.

---

### **Progress Monitoring**
- **Weekly Review**: Conduct a weekly review of completed milestones and adjust timelines if needed.
- **Performance Testing**: Test data pipelines and models after each milestone to ensure continuity and reliability.
- **Version Control**: Use GitHub for tracking code changes and milestone completions.
