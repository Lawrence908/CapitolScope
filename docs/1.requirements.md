#### **Must-Have (M)**

1. **Data Collection and Integration**
    
    - Integration with free APIs (AlphaVantage, yFinance) to fetch stock price data and indicators.
    - A pipeline for ingesting Congress trading data (e.g., through your custom dataflow).
2. **Hybrid Architecture**
    
    - Use OOP for modeling entities like:
        - `Stock` with attributes such as `ticker`, `price`, and methods like `calculate_moving_average()`.
        - `CongressTrade` with attributes like `member_name`, `stock`, `trade_type`.
    - Use functional programming and data-centric libraries (e.g., pandas, NumPy) for batch processing and transformations of large datasets.
3. **Efficient Data Pipeline**
    
    - Build a robust data pipeline for ingesting, storing, and querying large datasets.
    - Support real-time data updates and efficient batch processing.
4. **Technical Analysis Features**
    
    - Incorporation of basic technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI, MACD).
    - Historical data storage for backtesting.
5. **Machine Learning**
    
    - Initial model for identifying trends or predicting stock price increases.
    - Integration of Congress trading data as a feature in the ML model.
6. **Performance Metrics**
    
    - Automated tracking and visualization of:
        - Strategy performance metrics (e.g., profit, ROI).
        - Model accuracy and feature importance.
7. **Deployment and Testing**
    
    - AWS deployment with cloud storage and compute setup.
    - A simulated trading environment for testing strategies.

#### **Should-Have (S)**

1. **Advanced Data Sources**
    
    - Transition to premium APIs for higher data reliability and frequency.
    - Include financial statement analysis (e.g., earnings, debt) as features.
2. **Portfolio Management**
    
    - Simulated portfolio tracking and performance metrics.
    - Risk management tools, such as stop-loss simulation.
3. **User Interface**
    
    - A basic web dashboard to view results of analysis, trends, and predictions.

#### **Could-Have (C)**

1. **Additional Data Features**
    
    - Sentiment analysis from news or social media.
    - Policy impact modeling (e.g., tracking legislation or regulatory changes).
2. **Advanced Machine Learning**
    
    - Deep learning models for prediction.
    - Reinforcement learning for autonomous strategy improvement.
3. **Trading Account Integration**
    
    - API-based connection to a trading platform (e.g., Alpaca, Interactive Brokers) for live testing.

#### **Won’t-Have (W)**

1. **Real-Time Trading (Initial Phase)**
    - Live trading will not be included in the first phase to avoid financial risk.
2. **Enterprise-Grade Features**
    - Advanced scaling and fault tolerance won’t be prioritized initially.
